# ErrorStackOverflow & underflow state

## Procedure
### EVM behavior
stack overflow and underflow error can happen within any step which involves stack operation.
each op code have fixed `min_stack_pointer` & `max_stack_pointer`.  if current stack pointer < `min_stack_pointer`, 
overflow error happens, if current stack pointer > `max_stack_pointer`, underflow error happens.

when any one type error occurs:
1. If it's a root call, it ends the execution.
2. Otherwise, it restores caller's context and switch to it.

### Circuit behavior 
1. in order to get each step(op code)'s `min_stack_pointer` & `max_stack_pointer` value, construct new fixed tag
called `opcode_stack` which holds the data.
2. look up `opcode_stack` to retrieve current executing step's stack info(`minStack` & `maxStack`) 
3. combine stack overflow & underflow circuit into one, need to check `is_stack_overflow` and `is_stack_underflow`
is bool and only one is true at the mean while
4. common error handling:
  - the call's `IsSuccess` must be false 
  - If it's a root call, it transits to `EndTx`.
  - if it is not root call, it restores caller's context by reading to `rw_table`, then does step state transition to it.
