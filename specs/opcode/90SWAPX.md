# SWAPX op code

## Procedure

Swapx represents op codes of swap1....swap16. which swaps the top of the stack with the 'x+1'th last element. For example, SWAP3 means swaping the top of the stack with the 4th last element

## Constraints

1. opId = OpcodeId(0x90...0x9F)
2. state transition:\
   gc + 4 (2 reads + 2 writes)\
   stack_pointer\
   pc + 1\
   gas + 3
3. lookups: 1 range lookup + 4 bussmapping lookups:\
   position 'x' range from \[1..16\]\
   first operand must come from top of stack\
   second operand must come from position 'x+1' inside stack\
   when this operation done, the top stack value must equals 'x+1'th value before
   when this operation done, the 'x+1'th stack value must equals the top value before

## Exceptions

1. gas out:\
   remaining gas is not enough
2. stack underflow:\
   when stack length is less than swap position 'x + 1', i.e stack have 3 elements but the op is swap3, swap4, ..., swap16. Underflow condition for `swap_x`: `0 <= x +  stack_pointer - 1024 <= 16`, which requires a `Range17` lookup check.
