# GAS opcode

## Procedure

The `GAS` opcode gets the amount of available gas, including the correspoding reduction for the cost of the instruction itself.

## EVM behaviour

The `GAS` opcode loads a 64-bit value for the available gas from the current state, and pushes it to the stack.

## Circuit behaviour

1. bus-mapping lookup for stack write operation
2. compare against current state's gas left

## Constraints

1. opId == 0x5A
2. State transition:
   - gc + 1 (1 stack write)
   - `stack_pointer` - 1
   - pc + 1
   - gas + 2
3. Lookups:
   - `gas` is on the top of stack
4. Others:
   - Equality constraint: `gas == curr.gas_left - 2`

## Exceptions

1. Stack overflow: stack is full, stack pointer = 0
2. out of gas: remaining gas is not enough
