# BALANCE opcode

## Procedure

The `BALANCE` opcode gets balance of the given account.

## EVM behaviour

The `BALANCE` opcode pops `address` (20 bytes of data) off the stack and pushes
the balance of the corresponding account onto the stack. If the given account
doesn't exist (by checking non existing flag), then it will push 0 onto the
stack instead.

## Circuit behaviour

1. Construct call context table in rw table.
2. Do bus-mapping lookup for stack read, call context read and account read
   operations.
3. Do bus-mapping lookup for transaction access list write and stack write
   operations.

## Constraints

1. opId = 0x31
2. State transition:
   - gc + 7 (1 stack read, 1 stack write, 3 call context reads, 1 account reads,
     1 transaction access list write)
   - stack_pointer + 0 (one pop and one push)
   - pc + 1
   - gas:
     - the accessed `address` is warm: GAS_COST_WARM_ACCESS
     - the accessed `address` is cold: GAS_COST_ACCOUNT_COLD_ACCESS
3. Lookups: 7 busmapping lookups
   - `address` is at top of the stack.
   - 3 reads from call context for `tx_id`, `rw_counter_end_of_reversion`, and
     `is_persistent`.
   - `address` is added to the transaction access list if not already present.
   - If witness value `exists == 1`, lookup account `balance`. Otherwise lookup
     account non-existing proof.
   - The BALANCE result is at the new top of the stack.
4. Additional Constraints
   - value `is_warm` matches the gas cost for this opcode.

## Exceptions

1. stack underflow: if the stack starts empty
2. out of gas: remaining gas is not enough
