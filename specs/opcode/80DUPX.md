# DUPX opcode

## Procedure

dupx represents op codes of dup1....dup16. which picks up value at 'x' position inside the stack, then push the value to stack.

## Constraints

1. opId = OpcodeId(0x80...0x8F)
2. state transition:
   - gc + 2 (read + write)
   - stack_pointer - 1
   - pc + 1
   - gas + 3
3. lookups: 1 range lookup + 2 bussmapping lookups:
   - position 'x' range from \[1..16\]
   - operand must come from position 'x' inside
   - stack
   - position 'x' value equals stack top value when this operation done

## Exceptions

1. gas out: remaining gas is not enough
2. stack overflow: when stack is full, which means stack pointer is 0 before dupx
3. stack underflow: when stack length is less than dup position 'x'
