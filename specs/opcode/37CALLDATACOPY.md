# CALLDATACOPY opcode

## Procedure

The `CALLDATACOPY` opcode pops `memory_offset`, `data_offset`, and `length` from the stack.
It then copies `length` bytes from call data buffer at the offset `data_offset` to the memory at the
address `memory_offset`. EVM also pads 0 to the end of call data buffer in the case of out-of-bound
access to the call data buffer.

The gas cost of `CALLDATACOPY` opcode consists of two parts: constant cost 3 and dynamic cost.
The dynamic cost includes the memory expansion cost and copier cost in terms of the number of
words copied. Note that when `length = 0`, the memory expansion cost is 0 regardless of
`memory_offset` value.

## Circuit behaviour

Because the `length` is dynamic, it requires multiple step slots to fully verify the `CALLDATACOPY`.
In the `CALLDATACOPY` circuit, it only constrains the stack pops, state transition, and lookups to
retrieve the additional information such as tx id, call data offset, etc.
Then the gadget transits to an internal state called `CopyToMemory`, which can loop itself for
copying data to the memory if `length > 0`.

## Constraints

1. opId = 0x37
2. State transition:
   - rw_counter
     - +5 for root calls (3 stack read, 2 call context reads)
     - +6 for internal calls (3 stack read, 3 call context reads)
   - stack_pointer + 3
   - pc + 1
   - gas + 3 + dynamic cost (memory expansion and copier cost when `length > 0`)
   - memory_size
     - `max(prev_memory_size, (memory_offset + length + 31) / 32)` if `length > 0`
     - `prev_memory_size` if `length = 0`.
3. Lookups: 5 (root calls) or 6 (internal calls)
   - `memory_offset` is at the top of the stack
   - `data_offset` is at the second position of the stack
   - `length` is at the third position of the stack
   - for root calls (`is_root = 1`):
     - `tx_id` is in the rw table (call context)
     - `call_data_length` is in the rw table (call context)
   - for internal calls (`is_root = 0`):
     - `caller_id` is in the rw table (call context)
     - `call_data_length` is in the rw table (call context)
     - `call_data_offset` is in the rw table (call context)

## Exceptions

1. stack underflow: `1021 <= stack_pointer <= 1024`
2. out of gas: remaining gas is not enough
