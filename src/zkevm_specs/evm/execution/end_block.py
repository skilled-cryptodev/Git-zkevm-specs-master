# EndBlock is an execution state that constraints the following:
# A. Once the EndBlock state is reached, there's no other execution states
# appearing until the end of the EVM Circuit.  In particular, after the first
# EndBlock, there will be no new lookups to the rw_table.
#
# B. The number of meaningful entries (non-padding) in the rw_table match the
# rw_counter after the EndBlock state is processed.
#
# C. The number of txs processed by the EVM Circuit match the number of txs in
# the TxTable
#
# As an extra point:
# D. We need to prove that at least one EndBlock state exists
#
# Also:
# E. We need to prove that CumulativeGasCost does not excee the gas limit
#
# We prove (A) by constraining the transition rule that after an EndBlock
# state, only an EndBlock state can follow.
#
# We prove (B) by proving that at least `MAX_RWS - total_rws` padding elements
# exist in the rw table.  To achieve this, we do padding at the beginning of
# the RwTable with a sequential index `rw_counter`.  The RwTable constraints
# that padding rows have sequential indexes, so by doing 2 lookups with
# rw_counter = {a, b} we know there are at least b-a padding rows.
#
# We prove (C) by showing that the transaction ID after the last one processed
# corresponds to a padding tx in the TxTable, which enforces that once a
# padding txs appears in the table, the rest will also be padding.  This way,
# we know that if a padding tx with tx_id exist, then at most there are tx_id-1
# non-padding txs.  In case we have exhausted the TxTable with txs, we won't
# have any padding txs; so we skip the lookup.
#
# We prove (D) in the circuit implementation by constraining that the last
# execution step at the end of the EVM circuit is an EndBlock.  When the number
# of steps is less than the EVM circuit height, we pad at the end with
# EndBlock.  This will require the EndBlock to have height = 1 in the circuit,
# which can be achieved after reducing the number of cells used in the state
# selector.
#
# We prove (E) by quering the block table for the gas limit and the rw table for
# the cumulative gas and ensuring CumulativeGasCost <= GasLimit.

# Count the max number of txs that the TxTable can hold by counting rows of
# type CallerAddress.
